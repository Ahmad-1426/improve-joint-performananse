# 3D Joint Design – Improved for Structural Strength

## Description
This project contains a 3D model of a mechanical joint designed and optimized for improved durability and structural strength. The design was based on predefined dimensional constraints and developed as part of an engineering task.

## Tools Used
- **Onshape** – 3D modeling and design
- **SolidWorks** – Export format and compatibility

## Project Goal
To redesign a joint for enhanced mechanical performance while respecting the provided dimensions (e.g., 54.00 mm width, 29.00 mm height, etc.).

## File Format
- The final model is exported in **SolidWorks Part format (.SLDPRT)** for easy integration and modification in SolidWorks.
- Additional formats (STEP or Parasolid) can be provided if needed.

## How to Use
1. Open `joint_design.SLDPRT` using SolidWorks 2020 or later.
2. Review or modify the design based on your needs.
3. Use for simulation, manufacturing, or further development.
